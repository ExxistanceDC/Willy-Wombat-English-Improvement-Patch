# Willy Wombat English Improvement Patch
An English improvement patch for the Sega Saturn Japanese exclusive, <a href=https://segaretro.org/Willy_Wombat>Willy Wombat</a>.



## **Overview**
Willy Wombat is a charming 3D platformer/collectathon for the Sega Saturn. It features fully-voiced English audio, so it's very playable for English speakers. However, key menus are in Japanese, so this patch redraws several elements in English. Changes include:

- Title RAM choice translated
- Translated Options menu
- Translated Save/Load menu
- All English interstitial loading screens

What is *not* changed:

- The Japanese subtitles during character dialogue. We searched high and low in the game files, but could not source these. Perhaps for a future patch release.
